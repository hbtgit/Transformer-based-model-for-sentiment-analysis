Explanation of Transformer Architecture

The Transformer is a sequence-to-sequence model that relies entirely on attention mechanisms, eliminating the need for recurrent or convolutional layers. It’s widely used in NLP tasks like translation, text generation, and classification. Below are the key steps in the Transformer architecture:

    Input Embedding:
        Raw input tokens (words or subwords) are converted into dense vectors using an embedding layer.
        These embeddings capture semantic meanings and are learned during training.
    Positional Encoding:
        Since Transformers lack sequential processing (unlike RNNs), positional encodings are added to the input embeddings to provide information about the position of each token in the sequence.
        Positional encodings are typically fixed (using sine and cosine functions) or learned.
    Encoder Stack:
        The Transformer consists of a stack of identical encoder layers (e.g., 6 in the original paper).
        Each encoder layer has two main sub-layers:
            Multi-Head Self-Attention: Computes attention scores to focus on different parts of the input sequence, capturing relationships between tokens.
            Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFN): Applies a position-wise fully connected layer to each token’s representation.
        Residual connections and layer normalization are applied after each sub-layer to stabilize training.
    Decoder Stack:
        The decoder also consists of a stack of identical layers (e.g., 6).
        Each decoder layer has three sub-layers:
            Masked Multi-Head Self-Attention: Prevents attending to future tokens in the sequence (used for autoregressive tasks like translation).
            Multi-Head Cross-Attention: Attends to the encoder’s output to align input and output sequences.
            Feed-Forward Neural Network: Similar to the encoder’s FFN.
        Residual connections and layer normalization are applied as in the encoder.
    Attention Mechanism:
        The core of the Transformer is the Scaled Dot-Product Attention:
            Computes attention scores as:
            Attention(Q,K,V)=softmax(QKTdk)VAttention(Q,K,V)=softmax(dk​

            ​QKT​)V
            QQ (queries), KK (keys), and VV (values) are derived from the input embeddings, and dkdk​ is the dimension of the keys.
        Multi-Head Attention runs multiple attention mechanisms in parallel, allowing the model to capture different relationships.
    Output Projection:
        The decoder’s final output is passed through a linear layer followed by a softmax to produce probabilities over the vocabulary for each token in the output sequence.
    Training:
        The model is trained using a loss function like cross-entropy for tasks like translation or classification.
        Techniques like teacher forcing are used during training for sequence generation tasks.

Practical Application: Sentiment Analysis with a Transformer

For the practical application, we’ll implement a Transformer-based model for sentiment analysis (classifying movie reviews as positive or negative) using PyTorch. The dataset will be a simplified synthetic dataset for demonstration, but you can replace it with a real dataset like IMDb.

The implementation will include:

    A small Transformer encoder for text classification.
    Tokenization using a simple word-based tokenizer.
    Training the model to predict sentiment labels.
